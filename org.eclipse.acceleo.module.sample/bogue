The generation failed to generate any file because there are no model elements that matches at least the type of the first parameter of one of your main templates. 
The problem may be caused by a problem with the registration of your metamodel, please see the method named "registerPackages" in the Java launcher of your generator. It could also come from a missing [comment @main/] 
in the template used as the entry point of the generation.
